# FadRec (Screen Recording) Implementation Tasks

## 📋 Overview

This document tracks the implementation of FadRec, the screen recording feature for FadCam. FadRec will enable users to record their device screen with audio, following the same modular architecture as the existing camera recording feature.

**Key Design Principles:**

- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming with inheritance to reuse FadCam classes
- ✅ Modular folder structure (`fadrec` package)
- ✅ Extend existing classes instead of rewriting
- ✅ Keep it minimal and practical
- ✅ Use OpenGL for live watermarking (no FFmpeg post-processing)

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Core Functionality

- [x] Screen recording using MediaProjection API (dynamic resolution matching device screen, 30fps)
- [x] Audio recording (microphone support)
- [x] Start/Stop/Pause/Resume controls
- [x] Notification controls during recording
- [x] Background recording support
- [x] **BUG FIX:** VirtualDisplay resolution matches MediaRecorder (black video fixed)
- [x] **UI FIX:** ModeSwitcher visual state updates properly (red underline moves)

### Integration Goals

- [x] Mode switching between FadCam and FadRec in Home tab
- [x] ModeSwitcher visual feedback working correctly
- [x] Unified video management in Records tab (FadRec videos mixed with FadCam)
- [x] Reuse existing video operations (rename, delete, share via inheritance)
- [ ] Settings tab context-based (show FadRec settings when in FadRec mode)

---

## 📦 Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure

### 1.1 Package Structure

**Create new package:** `app/src/main/java/com/fadcam/fadrec/`

- [x] Create folder structure: `fadrec/services/`, `fadrec/ui/`, `fadrec/settings/`

### 1.2 Constants & Configuration

- [x] Add FadRec-specific constants to `Constants.java`
  - [x] `RECORDING_DIRECTORY_FADREC` = "FadRec"
  - [x] `RECORDING_FILE_PREFIX_FADREC` = "FadRec\_"
  - [x] Screen recording intent actions and broadcast constants
  - [x] Default FHD quality settings (1920x1080)
  - [x] Default FPS (30fps)
  - [x] Audio source constants (mic only for now)

### 1.3 Permissions & Manifest Updates

- [x] Extend `SharedPreferencesManager.java` with screen recording methods
  - [x] Current screen recording state
  - [x] Audio source preference (mic/none)
  - [x] Watermark enabled state

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Separate Service**: ScreenRecordingService in `fadrec/services/` package, completely separate from RecordingService
2. **Mode-based UI**: HomeFragment dynamically switches context, Settings tab shows context-appropriate options
3. **Unified Records**: FadCam and FadRec videos mixed together, distinguishable by filename prefix
4. **Inheritance & Reuse**: Extend existing settings fragments, reuse video operations (rename, delete, share)
5. **OpenGL Watermarking**: Real-time watermarking using existing GLRecordingPipeline (no FFmpeg post-processing)
6. **Minimal & Practical**: Default FHD quality, no complex configuration, focus on core functionality
7. **Modular Package**: `com.fadcam.fadrec/` folder structure for better organization

## 🎓 Implementation Guidelines

### Coding Standards (From copilot.instructions.md)

1. ✅ Follow Google/Oracle Java style guides
2. ✅ Single Responsibility Principle - one class, one purpose
3. ✅ Methods should be ≤ 50 lines
4. ✅ Clear naming with action verbs
5. ✅ Never silently swallow exceptions
6. ✅ Use structured logging (SLF4J/Log4j, not System.out.println)
7. ✅ Avoid code duplication (DRY principle)
8. ✅ Add Javadoc for public classes/methods
9. ✅ Use inheritance and OOP patterns to extend FadCam classes
10. ✅ Build and install after changes: `./gradlew.bat compileDebugJavaWithJavac installDebug`

### Hardware Considerations

- Assume hardware/OEM differences across devices
- MediaProjection API behavior varies by manufacturer
- Test on real devices (Samsung, Pixel, Xiaomi, OnePlus)
- Handle codec availability differences gracefully
