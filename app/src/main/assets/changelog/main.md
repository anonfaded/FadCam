<!-- 
    CHANGELOG FORMAT GUIDE
    =====================
    
    Markdown Syntax:
    - Use # for main headers (h1)
    - Use ## for section headers (h2)  
    - Use ### for subsection headers (h3)
    - Use --- on its own line for visual dividers
    - Use - for bullet points
    - Emojis are supported throughout
    
    Example:
    # Main Title (h1 - largest, uses 28sp)
    ## Section Title (h2 - 22sp)
    ### Subsection (h3 - 18sp)
    
    - Bullet point content
    - Another point
    
    --- (becomes visual divider)
    
    # Next Major Section

    # You can use images too, paste them in assets/changelog/ and reference like this:
    ![demo.png](demo.png)
    
    NOTE: This file is parsed to render dividers, headers, and content dynamically.

# Note
`Many users are unaware of a hidden feature in FadCam. Yes, there is a trash directory, but it is normally inaccessible for the user’s privacy. To access it, simply long-press the FadCam icon you see in the header of the Home tab, and you will enter it. From there, you can recover deleted files or permanently delete them. Hopefully, this will reduce emails about “Where is my deleted video?” :)`
