# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Faditor Mini is a lightweight video editor integrated into the FadCam app that allows users to perform basic video editing operations on their recorded videos. This feature will replace the current "Coming soon" placeholder with a functional video editor that leverages the existing FFmpeg AAR dependency for video processing operations.

## Requirements

2. WHEN the user taps on a video selection button THEN the system SHALL open a file picker to browse device videos
3. WHEN the user selects a video file THEN the system SHALL load and display the video in the editor interface
4. IF the selected video format is not supported THEN the system SHALL display an error message with supported formats
5. WHEN a video is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL display video metadata (duration, resolution, file size)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview my video with playback controls, so that I can navigate through the video while editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video is loaded THEN the system SHALL display a video preview player

5. WHEN the video reaches the end THEN the system SHALL automatically pause and reset to beginning
6. WHEN the user taps on the timeline THEN the system SHALL seek to that position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to trim video segments, so that I can remove unwanted parts from my videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters trim mode THEN the system SHALL display start and end trim handles on the timeline

6. IF trimming fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and revert to original video

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my edited video, so that I can save the changes and use the video elsewhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the export button THEN the system SHALL display export options (quality, format)
2. WHEN the user confirms export settings THEN the system SHALL start processing the video with FFmpeg
3. WHEN export is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator with percentage
4. WHEN export completes successfully THEN the system SHALL save the video to the device and show success message
