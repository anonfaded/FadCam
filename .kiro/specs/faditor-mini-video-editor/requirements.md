# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Faditor Mini is a lightweight video editor integrated into the FadCam app that allows users to perform basic video editing operations on their recorded videos. This feature will replace the current "Coming soon" placeholder with a functional video editor that leverages the existing FFmpeg AAR dependency for video processing operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a FadCam user, I want to select and load videos from my device into the editor, so that I can edit my recorded videos or other videos on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the Faditor Mini tab THEN the system SHALL display a video selection interface
2. WHEN the user taps on a video selection button THEN the system SHALL open a file picker to browse device videos
3. WHEN the user selects a video file THEN the system SHALL load and display the video in the editor interface
4. IF the selected video format is not supported THEN the system SHALL display an error message with supported formats
5. WHEN a video is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL display video metadata (duration, resolution, file size)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview my video with playback controls, so that I can navigate through the video while editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video is loaded THEN the system SHALL display a video preview player
2. WHEN the user taps the play button THEN the system SHALL start video playback
3. WHEN the user taps the pause button THEN the system SHALL pause video playback
4. WHEN the user drags the seek bar THEN the system SHALL update the video position accordingly
5. WHEN the video reaches the end THEN the system SHALL automatically pause and reset to beginning
6. WHEN the user taps on the timeline THEN the system SHALL seek to that position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to trim video segments, so that I can remove unwanted parts from my videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters trim mode THEN the system SHALL display start and end trim handles on the timeline
2. WHEN the user drags the start handle THEN the system SHALL update the trim start position
3. WHEN the user drags the end handle THEN the system SHALL update the trim end position
4. WHEN the user confirms the trim operation THEN the system SHALL process the video using FFmpeg
5. WHEN trimming is complete THEN the system SHALL update the preview with the trimmed video
6. IF trimming fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and revert to original video

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my edited video, so that I can save the changes and use the video elsewhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the export button THEN the system SHALL display export options (quality, format)
2. WHEN the user confirms export settings THEN the system SHALL start processing the video with FFmpeg
3. WHEN export is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator with percentage
4. WHEN export completes successfully THEN the system SHALL save the video to the device and show success message
5. WHEN export completes THEN the system SHALL offer options to share or view the exported video
6. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry option

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the editor interface to follow the app's design system, so that it feels integrated and consistent with the rest of FadCam.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the editor loads THEN the system SHALL use the same color scheme and theming as other app fragments
2. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN the system SHALL use consistent typography, spacing, and component styles
3. WHEN showing buttons and controls THEN the system SHALL use the same visual style as other app screens
4. WHEN displaying the header bar THEN the system SHALL match the style of other fragment headers
5. WHEN in dark mode THEN the system SHALL respect the app's dark theme colors and styling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during video processing operations, so that I understand what's happening and can wait appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any video processing starts THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL show progress percentage when available
3. WHEN processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining what went wrong
5. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable editing controls to prevent conflicts
6. WHEN the user tries to navigate away during processing THEN the system SHALL warn about canceling the operation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and seamless video editing operations, so that I can edit videos efficiently without long wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing trim operations THEN the system SHALL use hardware acceleration via OpenGL for optimal performance
2. WHEN processing videos THEN the system SHALL maintain lossless quality for supported operations
3. WHEN editing large or high-resolution videos THEN the system SHALL complete operations in under 30 seconds for typical trim operations
4. WHEN the device supports hardware encoding THEN the system SHALL utilize GPU acceleration for video processing
5. WHEN performing real-time preview THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth 30fps playback without stuttering
6. WHEN switching between different timeline positions THEN the system SHALL seek to positions within 100ms

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the editor to handle various video formats efficiently, so that I can edit videos regardless of their original encoding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading videos THEN the system SHALL support common formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV) with hardware decoding when available
2. WHEN processing videos THEN the system SHALL automatically detect optimal processing method (lossless vs re-encoding)
3. WHEN trim operations don't require re-encoding THEN the system SHALL perform stream copying for instant results
4. WHEN re-encoding is necessary THEN the system SHALL use hardware encoders (MediaCodec) with OpenGL acceleration
5. WHEN exporting videos THEN the system SHALL maintain original quality settings unless user specifies otherwise
6. WHEN using OpenGL processing THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance across all supported Android devices
